## Introduction

During my internship, I focused on understanding and implementing key cybersecurity practices to detect, analyze, and respond to potential security threats. This report outlines the practical applications of various cybersecurity tools and techniques, including log analysis, threat hunting, network traffic analysis, and endpoint security.

## Log Analysis and Anomaly Detection

### Overview
Log analysis is critical for identifying abnormal login attempts and potential security breaches. This section covers how to leverage log data to detect suspicious activities within a network.

### Key Concepts
- **Centralized Log Management**: Utilizing tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, and SIEM for log aggregation and analysis.
- **Baseline Behavior**: Establishing a baseline of normal network activity to identify anomalies.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Recognizing unusual patterns such as multiple failed login attempts or logins from different geographical locations.

### Tools Used
- **OSQuery**: Installed on a Linux server for querying logs.
- **Splunk**: Used to visualize and analyze log data for detecting anomalies.

### Example Query
- Created a query in Splunk to detect multiple failed login attempts within a short period.

## Threat Hunting

### Overview
Threat hunting involves proactively searching for undetected threats within the network. This section emphasizes the techniques and tools used for malware detection.

### Key Concepts
- **OSINT and Threat Intelligence**: Staying updated with the latest threat actor tactics.
- **Network Monitoring**: Using SIEM and EDR tools to monitor unusual network traffic patterns.
- **Automation**: Implementing SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) for efficient threat detection.

### Tools Used
- **OSQuery** and **Sysmon**: Used for monitoring system behavior and identifying potential malware indicators.

## Network Traffic Analysis

### Overview
This section outlines the processes for analyzing network traffic to detect potential cyber attacks.

### Key Concepts
- **NIDS/NIPS**: Understanding the difference between network intrusion detection and prevention systems.
- **Signature-Based Detection**: Identifying known attack patterns.
- **Behavior-Based Detection**: Utilizing machine learning to detect unknown attacks.

### Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Captured and analyzed network traffic for signs of potential attacks, such as port scanning and abnormal DNS queries.

### Findings
- Documented unusual traffic patterns indicating possible security incidents, along with proposed mitigation strategies.

## SIEM Configuration and Monitoring

### Overview
Setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system is essential for monitoring and responding to security incidents.

### Key Concepts
- **Asset Identification**: Determining which assets to monitor based on criticality.
- **Log Collection**: Configuring log sources (firewalls, servers, endpoints) for effective monitoring.
- **Alert Customization**: Creating alerts for suspicious activities, such as high numbers of failed login attempts.

### Tools Used
- **Splunk**: Configured to collect logs and set up alerts for potential security incidents.

## Endpoint Security and Malware Detection

### Overview
This section covers the detection and response procedures for malware infections on endpoints.

### Key Concepts
- **Detection Methods**: Differentiating between automatic and manual detection techniques.
- **Incident Response**: Steps for containing, eradicating, and recovering from malware infections.
- **Post-Incident Review**: Importance of documenting incidents and implementing security awareness training.

### Tools Used
- **Sysmon**: Used to monitor and log endpoint activities.
- **Process Explorer**: Utilized to identify unusual processes and behaviors.

### Example Scenario
- Simulated a malware infection in a test environment and documented the incident response steps taken to contain and remove the malware.

## Conclusion

This internship provided valuable insights into the practical applications of cybersecurity principles and tools. The hands-on experience gained through these exercises has solidified my understanding of critical SOC functions and prepared me for a future career in cybersecurity.
